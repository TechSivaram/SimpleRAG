# LIMS RAG System (Simplified Demo)

This repository contains a simplified C# demonstration of a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system, specifically tailored to illustrate how it could function within a **Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS)** environment.

The purpose of this demo is to showcase the core RAG workflow:
1.  **Retrieval:** Fetching relevant information from a knowledge base based on a user's query.
2.  **Generation:** Using a Large Language Model (LLM) to synthesize an answer, grounded in the retrieved information.

**Please Note:** This is a highly simplified example for conceptual understanding. It uses in-memory data structures and dummy implementations for key components (embedding model, vector database, LLM). A production-grade RAG system requires external services and more robust implementations.

## Features

* **Simulated Knowledge Base:** An in-memory collection of LIMS-related text snippets (SOPs, troubleshooting guides, sample results).
* **Basic Retrieval:** Uses a simple keyword-based search to simulate finding relevant information.
* **Dummy LLM:** A placeholder method to demonstrate how an LLM would integrate and generate a response using the retrieved context.
* **RAG Orchestration:** Shows the basic flow of taking a user query, retrieving context, and then generating an answer.

## How it Works (Simplified)

The `LimsRAGSystem` class orchestrates the RAG process:

1.  **`_knowledgeBase`:** A `Dictionary` holds pre-defined text chunks representing various LIMS documents and data.
2.  **`GenerateSimpleEmbedding` (Dummy):** This method is a placeholder for a real embedding model. In a true RAG system, this would convert text into numerical vectors.
3.  **`RetrieveRelevantContext`:** This method simulates a search in a vector database. It takes a user's query, performs a basic keyword match against the `_knowledgeBase`, and returns the most relevant text chunks.
4.  **`GenerateResponseAsync` (Dummy):** This method simulates an LLM. It takes the original user query and the retrieved text chunks, then combines them into a single response. In a real system, this would be an API call to a powerful LLM (e.g., OpenAI's GPT models).
5.  **`AskLimsRAG`:** This is the main orchestrator method that ties everything together:
    * It receives a `userQuery`.
    * Calls `RetrieveRelevantContext` to get relevant information.
    * Passes the `userQuery` and the `retrievedContexts` to `GenerateResponseAsync` to get the final answer.

## Setup and Run

This project requires the [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) to be installed on your system.

1.  **Clone the repository (or copy the code):**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url> # Replace with your repo URL
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

    If you're just using the provided code, save it as `LimsRAG.cs` in a new directory.

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    Open your terminal or command prompt and go to the directory where `LimsRAG.cs` is located.

3.  **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

You will see the simulated RAG system processing various LIMS-related queries and outputting dummy responses based on the hardcoded knowledge base.

## Code Overview

The core logic resides within the `LimsRAGSystem.cs` file (or `Program.cs` if you combined it).

* **`LimsRAGSystem` Class:** Encapsulates the entire RAG logic.
* **`_knowledgeBase`:** `Dictionary<string, string>` holding demo data.
* **`GenerateSimpleEmbedding(string text)`:** Placeholder for an embedding model.
* **`RetrieveRelevantContext(string userQuery, int topK = 3)`:** Simulates vector database search.
* **`GenerateResponseAsync(string userQuery, List<string> retrievedContexts)`:** Placeholder for LLM interaction.
* **`AskLimsRAG(string userQuery)`:** Orchestrates the RAG flow.
* **`Main(string[] args)`:** Entry point for the demo, making example queries.

## Moving to Production

This demo is a starting point. To build a production-ready RAG system for LIMS, you'll need to consider:

1.  **Real Knowledge Base:** Replace the `_knowledgeBase` dictionary with a dedicated **Vector Database** (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma, Qdrant).
    * **Data Ingestion Pipeline:** Implement a robust process to:
        * Load various LIMS documents (SOPs, instrument manuals, historical reports) and structured data.
        * Perform intelligent **chunking** of these documents.
        * Generate **embeddings** for each chunk using a high-quality embedding model.
        * Store these embeddings and their associated text in the vector database.
2.  **Real Embedding Model:** Integrate with an actual embedding model.
    * **Cloud-based:** Use services like **OpenAI's embedding API** (via `Azure.AI.OpenAI` NuGet package).
    * **Self-hosted/Local:** Deploy models like Sentence Transformers using `TorchSharp` or `ONNX Runtime` for local inference.
3.  **Real Large Language Model (LLM):** Replace the dummy LLM with an API call to a powerful LLM.
    * **Cloud-based:** **OpenAI GPT-4o, Claude 3, Google Gemini** (via their respective C# SDKs).
    * **Self-hosted:** Deploy open-source models like **Llama 3** or **Mistral** on your own infrastructure (e.g., using Ollama, Hugging Face TGI).
4.  **Advanced Retrieval:**
    * Implement **hybrid search** (combining semantic vector search with keyword/lexical search like BM25) for more accurate results, especially for LIMS data.
    * Explore **re-ranking** models to improve the relevance of retrieved documents before passing them to the LLM.
5.  **Robust Error Handling & Logging:** Implement comprehensive error management and detailed logging for debugging and monitoring.
6.  **Security and Compliance:**
    * Ensure **data privacy** and **security** (encryption, access control).
    * Adhere to **Indian regulatory compliance** (e.g., NABL guidelines) and international standards relevant to your lab.
    * Implement strict **audit trails** for all RAG interactions.
7.  **Scalability:** Design the system to handle increasing query loads and data volumes.
8.  **User Interface Integration:** Seamlessly integrate the RAG functionality into your existing LIMS product's user interface, perhaps as a smart search bar or a chatbot.
9.  **Continuous Improvement:** Establish a feedback loop for users and a process for regularly updating the knowledge base and evaluating RAG performance.
